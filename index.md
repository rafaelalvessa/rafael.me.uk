Hi, I'm Rafael. I'm a software engineer in London, UK. I was born in the early
1990s and I developed a passion for computers and the Internet from an early
age. My other passions include books, music (mostly classical, jazz and techno),
tea, chocolate and exploring the world (not in any particular
order). I'm a [Ravenclaw](https://www.wizardingworld.com/collections/ravenclaw).

Professionally, I make services for the Web. At the moment, I'm enjoying
programming in Rust and TypeScript. I'm also an advocate of free & open-source
software, and strive to contribute whenever I have some free time. Some of my
code is available on [GitHub]({{ site.github }}).

## Reading log

Take a look at the books I've been reading at [Reading log](/reading-log).
