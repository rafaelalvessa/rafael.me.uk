Hi, I'm Rafael. I'm a software engineer in London, UK. I was born in the early
1990s and I developed a passion for computers and the Internet from an early
age. My other passions include music (mostly classical and techno), books,
science, arts, tea, chocolate and exploring the world (not in any particular
order). I'm a [Ravenclaw](https://www.wizardingworld.com/collections/ravenclaw).

Professionally, I make software mainly for the Web. At the moment, I'm enjoying
Rust and TypeScript. I'm also an advocate for free & open-source software, and
strive to contribute when time permits. Some of my code is available on
[GitHub]({{ config(variable="github") }}).
